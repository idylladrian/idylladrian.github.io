			Last year, I rediscovered Toni Morrison’s work. I re-read Beloved, which I read in the tenth grade but felt that I originally could not fully understand because my reading comprehension was unimpressive when it came to school work. I had been more familiar with tidbits of her writing that I would come across in anthologies and I have always been drawn to the ways that she sculpted sentences. I also began to listen to interviews of her online where she gave commentary on her novels. I could listen to any of her interviews on repeat all day, but there was this one interview that I have held with me for months since I first heard it. Here is the excerpt that stands out to me from it:  

Mavis Nicholson (Interviewer): Well, slavery could be substituted for dire poverty. It could be substituted for somebody feeling crippled by life. I mean, like the irons in their mouth is the way in which some people can't speak about what they feel. I feel that the slavery in your book could be substituted by us, the readers, for whatever we almost want it to be too. 

Toni Morrison: I suppose, in fact, it does function that way. You don't really have to have those experiences. You only have to translate them into one's own individual and, I suppose, human terms because it's still with us, you know, the residue, not only the historical residue, but the... conscription, the problems that such women faced—then–-are still here. We still have to determine how to be complete human beings, how to be responsible to something larger than ourselves, how to be parents, how to be workers, how to be philanthropists, how to take care of and nurture the other, and at the same time, how to be this very unique person.

Mavis Nicholson (Interviewer): You began it because of a story you read about a woman called Margaret Garner who had killed her children because she couldn't bear them to... Live the way she had. 

Toni Morrison: Live the way she'd lived. She had escaped from slavery. She had made it into a free state with four children and... At that time, a slave owner could enter into free territory and take them back, sort of like the sanctuary movement that's going on in the States now. And the law was controversial. But at any rate, a month or so after she had gotten into free territory, the man did come for her. She saw him and instantly ran out into the back to kill those children. She wounded two, cut the throat of a third, and was about to bash the head of a fourth into the wall when they caught her and imprisoned her. So that story was haunting, you know, because it was not an exhausted mother. 
It was not contempt for the children. It was what she said. She was interviewed a lot. She's in her 20s and she's very serene. And she said only, “they will not live the way I have.” And death, she felt, was better. 

Mavis Nicholson (Interviewer): You often read in papers of, say, a case like a father who shot his family. and then shoots himself. And people say, “but he loved them. He was such a loving father. Why could he do it?” Could you get behind that thinking? Well, you did. You got behind it in Beloved. But how difficult is it for you to perceive of being able, to say, kill your own children, because you couldn't face life for them? 

Toni Morrison: It's a very, very extraordinary reaction, because what you just described, the fathers always take everybody with them. The mothers commit suicide and leave the children. They don't take their children with them. There's something very interesting about the ways in which males and females respond to that kind of despair. But a woman who takes her children's life, most of the literary precedents for it were Medea, who was really concerned with a man, and she was trying to hurt him by killing her own children, whom she loved. There were tales, I have read them, about women during the war who were in concentration camps who had to make quick choices, and any choice is the wrong one. And it was that moment anything that Margaret Garner would have chosen to do at that moment would have been a disaster. It was a perfect dilemma. I didn't know how to judge her. So the only one I felt who could judge her would be the daughter she killed. So she, in fact, does return in order to claim what she has been robbed of, which is a mother's love and life, and also to accuse her. She's the only one who can say, “how do you know death is better for me since you've never died?” Maybe it isn't. No one else is in a position to ask that question. 

…

Mavis Nicholson (Interviewer): When you get the ghost to confront or the person confronts her, the heroine who had killed the child, in the end, the heroine has to, herself, forgive herself. 

Toni Morrison: Oh, absolutely. regardless of the noble motives and the maternal feelings she had and the inescapable reasons for doing it, the whole house is inhabited by their desire for explaining, justifying, and when the ghost spirit moves and she sort of returns in the flesh, the consequences of that encounter are never what Sethe, the heroine, the mother, would have expected. All she wanted to do was to love her more, explain, “Let me tell you why i did it. You'll understand, won't you?” and of course the child doesn't understand at all. All she says is, “you left me.” 

Mavis Nicholson (Interviewer): Do you think it is possible then for someone to forgive themselves even when they've done something absolutely terrible? 

Toni Morrison: Yes, it's called grace. At some point you do. If you don't, you're in a cul-de-sac. But you have to go through the fire first. You have to experience the full fall. 
and to complete self-loathing in order to come around to something like the forgiving of oneself. It's when you skip responsibility, when you use a substitute emotion like guilt, which is of no use to anyone. But if you feel the real thing, which is shame, hatred, humiliation, and self-loathing, that is the door. And if you get through that, then you can forgive yourself. 

Mavis Nicholson (Interviewer): Do you think you ever did that when you were a young girl? Because I think I did. And I didn't know what I was guilty about. And I didn't know what I was loathing about myself. Probably that I was growing up and I didn't like myself in some ways. And any little misdeed I did, I felt was kind of horrifically big. 

Toni Morrison: I think I was unfortunate because that only came to me much later. It would have been healthier for me had I gone through that at an early stage. But for me it was much later because I was given to believe when I was young that I was smart and bright and cheeky and practically everything I did turned into something wonderful. So I sort of postponed the confrontation that I had around the time that I'm talking to you about when there was only me. in my own company. 

Mavis Nicholson (Interviewer): That's when you did it? 

Toni Morrison: That's when I did it. 

Mavis Nicholson (Interviewer): Do you think everybody at some point needs that confrontation with themselves? 

Toni Morrison: Absolutely. All of the characters in my books, whether they are successful or not, they're all pushed into that place where all the definitions of themselves are suspicious. 
You say you are my friend in “Sula.” Let me see what friendship is. Are you a good person? Are you a good mother? And the circumstances have to be invented so that the characters, which I believe is also true in life, you have to simply be stripped down and made very lean. And so that you can see who you are. And then you make peace. It's difficult, but it's absolutely important. Otherwise, you never arrive at this delicious place called adulthood. 

I felt attracted to this dialogue, being that I am in my twenties and so many others that I am close with are in their twenties, a period of immense and deep change. I initially felt awkward with Nicholson’s line of questioning for the work. I frequently get the sense that author’s who are distant from the dark subjects they engage with, can lean, to a fault, on the interpretive lens of a work’s themes. It reminded me of a movie review I had read some time beforehand for Hayao Miyazaki’s Pom-Poko. The animated film is about the resistance of a clan of tanooki, an animal species native to Japan, against the development of urban sprawl and the deforestation of the environment as Tokyo grows during the 90s. The most overt themes of the movie are related to colonialism and environmentalism, which are very real experiences for some people and can be heavily investigated. And yet, one of the most popular comments I found on critical media for the film were about how the displacement and change of the animals could be interpreted, more simply, as the experience of growing up. Watching the movie through the gaze of the remark, a position that I’m sure felt safe to its writer, flattened the story for me; which I was afraid the introductory comments by Nicholson’s would also do. Luckily, I felt intrigued by where the conversation arrived at.
	What is “this delicious place of adulthood”? This place that all people, in theory, should come to if given enough time. This state of being that people of both horrific and benevolent circumstances alike must pay a price for if they are to arrive. Adulthood has always been an elusive construct for me. The times where it has appeared most concretely to me is when I have felt like the child and my parents to be themselves, despite my age and understanding. I think I look at myself and understand the pre-adult experience to be one of ideals. As a young person, I have little choice in where I go, what I wear, what I can eat. I only have the ability of judgment for what is being chosen and provided for me. By the time I am sticking my fingers between seams to breach into the world, I have only judgements and the resolve for making choices that align with my judgments. But what happens when I’m on the other side and I’m trying to move along in life with these two things? I’m struck with the loneliness of it.
	
	I don’t like the way I behave, but my voice was singular against the ways that my parents and community raised me.
	
	I don’t like the way the world is functioning politically, but I am one person trying to convince many who do not agree with me. 

	I have been bigoted towards others, but I have had a singular experience of life and don’t fully understand some of the pain of others.

	I don’t want to make this choice, but I don’t have the support I need to make a better choice.

	I think I’m doing the right thing, but I only know so much as one person. 

I think there is this slap in the face of realizing how small you are as one person. The true branding into adulthood is learning that you are one person with a singular will and that there are many more people following their own desires, and many who have been doing so before you were even born. It is coming to the understanding that even though you have ironed out your morals, you may not always have the opportunity to measure your actions with it. And if your actions disappoint you, you may have to reckon with what that means.

When I was young, there was something about adults that I could not understand, mentioned by Toni Morrison: grace. Especially around the time I was developing my moral compass, I was having a hard time understanding how adults had the ability to give grace to each other. By the time I was in my late teens, I had known so many stories about how someone in my family had crossed another family member before, and yet, they would all be sitting in front of me for a holiday because they knew it was important to still come together. After my parents divorced and I learned about some particularly heinous things my dad had done, I found it incredulous that my mom would stand in the driveway and have a cigarette with him before passing us off for the weekend. Of course, there were emotions that ran the opposite direction of the actions, but it was something I was unable to do, unlike my parents. When I could not control my expression of emotions, is when I truly felt like a child. The kind of decorum that the adults in my life offered each other, was something out of reach.
I have found that older people are the most likely to be handing out grace. They have lived long enough to know we all make faults and they extend their patience. Although, some people die never knowing grace. I’ve met a few people who can never look into their heart. They move through life with a wall of scarring between their ideals and who they really are. I think it is a heavy burden on the soul to live this way. But they’ll never have to face the fire. Just get used to sitting upon the coals. 
	I feel like I have sunken down to the place of self-loathing a few times in the past few years. I have had to reconcile with my actions big and small. Especially in the loneliness that I’ve lived in, all you have is your memories to piece together who you are. Memories of who I have been when I didn’t have any choice to be different. Memories of when I wanted to act differently, and still didn’t. Memories of after I thought I had arrived to who I was supposed to be, and I still acted against what I thought was right. These are the weightier fibers that I use to create the image of myself, and I’ve learned that I must hold them as I hold the lighter ones that remind me of what makes me good. Without the anchor of realizing that we have something good in us, the fixation of mistakes consumes everything and eats away at the mind.
	I changed my circumstances at the beginning of this year. I am in a community that is very close-knit. I have many new friends. I am no longer depressed. And now that I have been given so much joy, I feel like I am safely able to look back into the fire and award myself grace. I have entered a period of life where I am holding the ideal and the actualization together in my mind, instead of perceiving myself as either-or. I am having an easier time holding my mistakes and making change when I have done something wrong. Perhaps my mind and circumstance will one again choose to smite my ego and throw me back into the pit, but I think I’m beginning to understand why my mom chose to smoke a cigarette in the driveway with my dad. Maybe I will lay with my friends and lovers, and we will bask in the silence of knowing our imperfections and that we still choose to look at each other’s souls. I hope this is what guides my experience of adulthood.



	I was in the airport waiting to take a plane back home from a vacation with my ex’s family. We were still dating at the time, but the relationship was falling apart. In many ways, I could not be the partner I was interested in being. And my then-partner, made me feel discarded and unimportant in his life while he was pursuing a new love interest. I spent two weeks sharing the same bed with him in a cramped boat, and I felt consumed by every passing hour of it with feelings of betrayal and desolation. I would go to sleep praying that there would be something I could do to feel loved. And then I would wake up repeating the things I could not forgive him for. It was one of the worst emotional experiences I’ve ever had. 
In the airport, his uncle and I were sitting together because the rest of the family had caught their flight and we were still waiting for ours. He was always kind to me before and after the trip. We were sitting on the porch of a hot cabin on one of our final vacation days and he opened up to me about some of his pains in life and his experience going to therapy. I was desperate to tell anyone about the depression I was feeling and I knew he would listen to me. I told him everything. About how I was in anguish in the moments I had seemed so content on the trip and about all of the different ways that my ex, his nephew, had made me feel neglected. I tried to water it down to spare him the perspective of seeing his godson in a negative light, but it was so apparent in my words how I really felt. He listened to me, his eyes became sadder the more I talked, and at the end of it he told me, “Adrian, that it is really tough.” He was very sincere. “If I were you, I would be shouting. I would be screaming and furious.” His eyes looked around the airport as he said that, like he was maybe imagining people’s reactions if he decided to have an outburst. “Thank you for telling me. I really admire… your ability to have grace through this.” On the flight home, which was my waiting room, until I would inevitably land in New York to be broken up with as a punctuation to my longest relationship, I would fall asleep asking myself, “is this what it means to be an adult?”
