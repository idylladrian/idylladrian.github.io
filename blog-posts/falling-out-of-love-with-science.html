			“I am a little scientist, in constant awe and amazement of the universe; running around and exploring the 
			forest in my backyard with my pocket-magnifying glass,” I wrote in my college application essay.</p>
			<p style="padding: 10px;"> “Ah yes,” 
			I thought to myself. “A small, explicative description of my youth; painting myself as having been a naturally 
			curious and astute researcher since I was able to walk. Just like the unnaturally-young honesty of Abraham 
			Lincoln or intelligence of Sandra Day O’Connor. They will have no choice but to accept my application because 
			I cannot make my inherent talent more clear.</p>
			<p style="padding: 10px;">
			“I was lying of course. Did I enjoy running around and playing 
			outside? Yes. Did I do it with a magnifying glass and a hypothesis in my head? No. When I reflected on the 
			qualities that I expected in a scientist, and compared them to myself: I did not see them. There was a 
			disconnect between my small-town upbringing and the superbly amazing life stories of the scientists I 
			wanted to embody from television and video games. When I got access to the internet, I spent hours googling 
			the accomplishments of high-achievers that were my age to gauge my distance from the scientist identity I 
			hoped I would embody someday. My favorite group of gifted kids to investigate were winners of international 
			junior science competitions. I would lay in bed wondering why I, at a near decrepit age of sixteen, had not 
			sequenced slug DNA, like that seventh-grader from Massachusetts. Perhaps it was my lack of drive. My 
			disappointingly-average aptitude for the sciences and math. No. It was probably because I was assigned too 
			many chores. Yes. I could not reach my full potential because I had to wash the dinner dishes twice a week. 
			</p>
			<p style="padding: 10px;">
			Now that I work as a scientist, I know that the occupation of a ‘scientist’ is not as cutthroat as I had 
			manufactured it to be. But in high school, all I could think to do was lie on my applications. If I didn’t 
			feel that I had the behaviors and affinities of a true scientist in the making, then I would at least tell 
			them that I did. And it worked.</p>
			<p style="padding: 10px;">
			The first time I credibly questioned the whole scientist-is-the-coolest-job-
			ever-thing was when I got into upper-level classes in college. After two years of taking classes that leaders 
			in academia meticulously designed to remind me that I was stupid, I had reached the level of education where 
			I could begin to specialize in my study. I had been promised by upper-classmen that “when you take the junior 
			and senior-level courses, is when the cool stuff starts.” My feigned enthusiasm for science that brought me to 
			the university had been exhausted because the advanced classes were also boring. Having fully engaged with 
			science in all ways that I was told were fun and realistic, I wondered what was wrong. With more introspection 
			and therapy, I deduced that my desire to be a scientist was actually a façade for a simpler desire: I wished to 
			push colorful buttons and work on the Starship Enterprise.</p>
			<p style="padding: 10px;">
			Unfortunately, it was quickly becoming clear to me 
			that becoming a scientist would not help me achieve my dream. Not because I was lacking anything, but because 
			no one, in fact, would be traveling faster-than-light on a super-cool, imaginary spaceship. At least, not 
			anytime soon.</p>
			<p style="padding: 10px;">
			I settled for environmental engineering as my area of focus. If I couldn’t run away to be an 
			astronaut in the way I wanted, I would at least be doing something for the planet. It was around this time, 
			that I also became really involved in learning and working with the decolonization groups on our campus. A 
			few close friends and I would regularly chat and work to further understand STEM through the lens of 
			colonialism and how its framework enabled violence. The last shreds of hope I had for enthusiasm in science 
			shriveled up as it became impossible not to question and critique every component of my learning. If I was 
			learning engineering to heal the environment, then why are we engaging in fossil fuels as a legitimate option 
			for the energy of the future in our lectures? I questioned professors why class is apolitical and capitalistic 
			when climate change is anything but apolitical and is exacerbated by capitalism. Why are the work and knowledge 
			of indigenous peoples, who are nearly the sole protectors of biodiversity and land, treated as inferior to 
			the understandings of white men? The excitement and intrigue left me quickly in my academic journey, but by 
			the end, so had my respect for the fields in their entirety.</p>
			<p style="padding: 10px;">
			After graduating from college, I work as an 
			environmental scientist at an environmental consulting firm (evil companies hire us to clean up their 
			environmental dumping after they get sued). I was very excited about my job when I started my internship. 
			Even if I disagreed with the theory of science and how it is performed, the praxis of cleaning the environment 
			would no doubt be a net positive that would nurture my desire to do good. SIKE! Please see my official statement 
			below on my job:</p>
			<p style="padding: 10px;">
			“After an extensive career (one year of interning, one year of full-time work) of assisting in 
			the development of plans for environmental cleanup, witnessing the crippling inefficiencies of bureaucracy that 
			actually is designed to support the offending polluters of our bodies of water, and being forced to work with 
			white, cishet, neurotypical “humans”; I advise that we all collectively quit our jobs and maybe stop taking 
			science so seriously because it’s a pretentious joke.“</p>
			<p style="padding: 10px;">
			P.S. We should still take vaccines seriously.</p>
			<p style="padding: 10px;">
			Vaccines aren’t a joke. Now I sit, almost 23, writing a blog post in a café, thinking to myself 
			“What’s next? because all of this seems silly”. I spent nearly my entire life wanting to become a scientist. 
			Now that I am one, I can feel this shape that I’ve massaged myself into, losing shape. A paper-mâché 
			cast of an identity that I was saving in the back, waiting for when I could finally slip into because it 
			would fit perfectly; it has disintegrated back into the paper.</p>
