			When I was small, I remember having this really intense desire to be lost. I would trail 
			as far as possible behind my parents when we went out to the store or a park. Sometimes they 
			would be out of sight for a minute and I would be somewhere where no one knew who I was. When 
			I would get to be a little lost, spaces and sensations became amplified and people appeared 
			different to me.</p>
			
			<p style="padding: 10px;">
			I still feel the tug of wanting to get lost now that I would describe myself 
			as ‘not small.’ I just moved, for the second time in my life to someplace where I don’t know 
			anyone or anyplace. The first week, the sensation of feeling lost was at its peak. Everything 
			was within a perspective of endless possibility because I could be anyone I wanted in this new 
			place. But I think its funny how quickly this viewpoint starts to morph, slowly but surely, 
			back into knowing-exactly-where-you-are. The same worldy-understanding that you have in your 
			home, a familiar setting, or when you’re holding your parents’ hands at the store.</p>
			
			<p style="padding: 10px;">
			Not only 
			is the apartment that I’m personalizing becoming more of a lodestone, but everywhere that is 
			unknown to me is quickly polarizing from mysterious-setting to simply not-home. My familiarity 
			with a place begets a fear of getting lost.</p>
			
			<p style="padding: 10px;">
			While my experience with being lost isn’t new, my 
			attention to it was recently sparked while listening to a conversation between Dr. Báyò Akómoláfé, 
			and Ayana Young, in the latter’s podcast, For the Wild. Dr. Akómoláfé, a writer and philosopher 
			among many other titles, references a phrase from his Yoruba Elders, “in order to find your way, 
			you must become lost,” in part of his response to defining “fugitivity.” This prompt regarding 
			“fugitivity” is an extension of a previous conversation held between the two and stems from Dr. 
			Akómoláfé’s own work and a book they admire, The Queer Art of Failure by Jack Halberstam.</p>
			
			<p style="padding: 10px;">
			The term 
			“lost” is much more than not knowing where you are. To be lost implies that you are outside of 
			structures; whether this be structures of knowing (I don’t know the directions to the supermarket), 
			structures of place (I left my old apartment), structures of society (I don’t know anyone here), 
			structures of identity (I have no responsibility to be who I was yesterday), and maybe, in a 
			scenario different than mine, structures of culture and hierarchy (I would like to live in a 
			gardening commune). Both Dr. Akómoláfé and Halberstam define the deliberate choice and experience 
			of being lost, as fugitivity.</p>
			
			<p style="padding: 10px;">
			Fugitivity, the intentional running away, is an act of subverting 
			systems that prevent change. To become fugitive is to allow yourself to be held by the tornado of 
			chaos that is always making things happen. It is an embodiment that allows us to evolve and 
			increase our imaginations.</p>
			
			<p style="padding: 10px;">
			When I moved to where I am now, I briefly experienced full fugitivity. 
			The unfamiliarity of the town and my newfound agency over my life both destroyed structures known 
			and unknown to me, permitting me a new way of being. With no one here to tell me who I am supposed 
			to be, I can make a choice to be whoever I want (and reap the consequences). But as I said, this 
			fugitivity is fleeting. I work a 9-to-5. I make dinner every night. I go to sleep at the same time 
			everyday. I exchange fugitivity for assured well-being. However, I don’t think think a life lacking 
			of fugitivity is amiable to my life goals and I’ve seen people die from the emotional chokehold of 
			too-many-structures. I hope to manifest and nuture my lostness. Queerness has always made it so 
			that a part of me that is lost in my world, and it has so far been a gift; I see future endeavors 
			towards getting lost only as an extension of it. I’m making an on-running list of how to remain 
			fugitive:</p>
			
			<UL>
			<LI><p>Walk in places you’ve never been before (that are safe to you)</p>
			<LI><p>Follow a bug around</p>
			<LI><p>Start conversations with people you don’t know</p>
			<LI><p>Write down your routine, and then don’t follow it</p>
			<LI><p>Don’t show up to work (if you can still figure out a way to get money)</p>
			<LI><p>Make art, but like, not Art</p>
			<LI><p>Go camping with literally nothing</p>
			<LI><p>Walk for 4 hours in one direction</p>
			<LI><p>Be a different person (version of yourself, not identity theft)</p>
			<LI><p>Try to go somewhere without any directions</p>
			<LI><p>Start up conversations with ducks at the park</p>
			<LI><p>Dress-up how you’ve always wanted and ask everyone you run into what they think of your look</p>
			<LI><p>Work an odd job</p>
			<LI><p>Grow a garden</p>
			<LI><p>Ask someone to explain something, and only ask questions</p>
			<LI><p>Question something that seems permanent</p>
			<LI><p>Enter into a wikipedia rabbit-hole</p>
			<LI><p>Plant seeds [ambiguous]</p>
			<LI><p>Kill someone</p>
			</UL>
			
			<p>More thoughts to come in the future as I continue to learn and experience.</p>
