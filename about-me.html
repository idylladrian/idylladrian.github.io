			<p>Hi! I'm Adrian and this is my website!</p>
			<p>I was raised in Southern California, the traditional homeland of the Cahuilla people, and am currently
				living in Upstate New York, the traditional homeland of the Mohican, Schaghticoke, and Haudenosaunee.</p>
			<p>My ancestors are indigenous to México, the British Isles, and Scandanavia. My relations of love and expression to myself 
				and others is constantly changing and amorphous, thus I describe myself as queer.</p>
			<p>I studied visual arts (lots of painting and drawing) at Idyllwild Arts Academy and have never stopped creating. I still
				draw and paint, but I do lots of other stuff too. In college, I became an instructor at the school's makerspace teaching
				woodworking, laser cutting, 3D printing, and sewing. And now I make websites (hehe). This year I've recently gotten into
				writing too. Writing has felt like the only way I've been able to process certain parts of my life, so it's been a
				necessity at certain times. But now, I feel like I can't stop writing. Poetry. Little thoughts. Stories. I'm always
				writing something. Sometimes it feels like I can only experience life in its entirety when I write. One of the reasons I
				made this website was to give me a place where I could put my writings and share them. I hope some of my subjects
				can pique your interest and we can chat about it!</p>
			<p>I received my bachelor's degree in environmental engineering from Brown University. I've always wanted to be a scientist
				since I was young and so I pursued a science degree to make it a reality. During my education, I learned about how 
				the world works and how to extrapolatie observation into creation. In many ways, I was making my dreams come true.
				But I was also beginning to navigate the world as an adult, and I was being asked to confront what it means to be an 
				upstanding member of my Mexican-American community—and consequently, how I would choose to show up for the liberation
				of others. By the end of my education, I came to the conclusion that the sciences would not contribute to making the
				world a better place in the ways that most people hope and assume, at least not how it was being taught to me. What is
				the place of science in the revolution? I'm not sure yet.</p>
			<p>Mmm mmm. So much to say about me and so little I can express in a single page. I guess if you wanna learn more, you can
				reach out and chat!</p>
